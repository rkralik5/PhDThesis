In Chapter~\ref{sec:NeutrinoTheory} I briefly introduce neutrinos and their current place in particle physics. I talk about the various source (Sec.~\ref{sec:NeutrinoProduction}) and detection (Sec.~\ref{sec:NeutrinoInteractions}) possibilities. In Sec.~\ref{sec:NeutrinoOscillation} I discuss the neutrino oscillation phenomenology and the current state of its experimental measurements. Section~\ref{sec:NuMass} discusses the possibilities for introducing the neutrino mass into the Standard Model and talks about their implications.

In Chapter~\ref{sec:NOvA} I introduce the NOvA experiment
