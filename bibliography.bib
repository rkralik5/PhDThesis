Such needs require the code to be consistently reliable over the entire energy range (from MeV to TeV) for all projectiles (full suite of elementary particles and heavy ions). Outside CERN, among various applications worldwide, FLUKA serves as a core tool for the HIT and CNAO hadron-therapy facilities in Europe. Therefore, medical applications further impose stringent requirements in terms of reliability and predictive power, which demands constant refinement of sophisticated nuclear models and continuous code improvement. Some of the latest developments implemented in FLUKA are presented in this paper, with particular emphasis on issues and concerns pertaining to CERN and medical applications.},

The channels considered are, quasielastic, single charge exchange, double charge exchange and absorption. The method combines a microscopic calculation of the intrinsic probabilities for each reaction as a function of the nuclear density, followed by a computer simulation procedure in order to trace the fate of the pions through the different channels. Double, single and integrated differential cross sections for quasielastic and charge exchange reactions, as well as absorption cross sections are calculated. The agreement with experimental data for the different reactions, energies and nuclei is rather remarkable with some limitations enforced by the approximations used.},

  abstract  = {Clustering algorithms are attractive for the task of class identification in spatial databases. However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large databases. The well-known clustering algorithms offer no solution to the combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an appropriate value for it. We performed an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 benchmark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1) DBSCAN is significantly more effective in discovering clusters of arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm CLAR-ANS, and that (2) DBSCAN outperforms CLARANS by a factor of more than 100 in terms of efficiency.},

  abstract = {In fuzzy clustering, the fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm is the best known and used method. Since the FCM memberships do not always explain the degrees of belonging for the data well, Krishnapuram and Keller proposed a possibilistic approach to clustering to correct this weakness of FCM. However, the performance of Krishnapuram and Keller's approach depends heavily on the parameters. In this paper, we propose another possibilistic clustering algorithm (PCA) which is based on the FCM objective function, the partition coefficient (PC) and partition entropy (PE) validity indexes. The resulting membership becomes the exponential function, so that it is robust to noise and outliers. The parameters in PCA can be easily handled. Also, the PCA objective function can be considered as a potential function, or a mountain function, so that the prototypes of PCA can be correspondent to the peaks of the estimated function. To validate the clustering results obtained through a PCA, we generalized the validity indexes of FCM. This generalization makes each validity index workable in both fuzzy and possibilistic clustering models. By combining these generalized validity indexes, an unsupervised possibilistic clustering is proposed. Some numerical examples and real data implementation on the basis of the proposed PCA and generalized validity indexes show their effectiveness and accuracy.},

With only an isotopic triplet of leptons coupled to a triplet of vector bosons (two charged decay-intermediaries and the photon) the theory possesses no partial-symmetries. Such symmetries may be established if additional vector bosons or additional leptons are introduced. Since the latter possibility yields a theory disagreeing with experiment, the simplest partially-symmetric model reproducing the observed electromagnetic and weak interactions of leptons requires the existence of at least four vector-boson fields (including the photon). Corresponding partially-conserved quantities suggest leptonic analogues to the conserved quantities associated with strong interactions: strangeness and isobaric spin.},

  abstract     = {A 14.6-kilogram sodium-doped CsI scintillator is used to detect a neutrino scattering process with a 6.7σ confidence level. Detecting neutrinos—elementary particles that barely interact with other matter—usually requires detectors of enormous size. A particular interaction of neutrinos with atomic nuclei, called the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEνNS), is predicted to occur with relatively high probability, and it could be used to drastically reduce the size of neutrino detectors. However, observing this interaction requires a source of low-energy neutrinos and detectors that contain nuclei of optimal mass. Akimov et al. observed CEνNS with a 6.7σ confidence by using a comparatively tiny, 14.6-kg sodium-doped CsI scintillator exposed to neutrinos from a spallation neutron facility (see the Perspective by Link). The discovery places tighter bounds on exotic, beyond-the-standard-model interactions involving neutrinos. Science, this issue p. 1123; see also p. 1098 The coherent elastic scattering of neutrinos off nuclei has eluded detection for four decades, even though its predicted cross section is by far the largest of all low-energy neutrino couplings. This mode of interaction offers new opportunities to study neutrino properties and leads to a miniaturization of detector size, with potential technological applications. We observed this process at a 6.7σ confidence level, using a low-background, 14.6-kilogram CsI[Na] scintillator exposed to the neutrino emissions from the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Characteristic signatures in energy and time, predicted by the standard model for this process, were observed in high signal-to-background conditions. Improved constraints on nonstandard neutrino interactions with quarks are derived from this initial data set.},

  abstract     = {The preponderance of matter over antimatter in the early universe, the dynamics of the supernovae that produced the heavy elements necessary for life, and whether protons eventually decay—these mysteries at the forefront of particle physics and astrophysics are key to understanding the early evolution of our universe, its current state, and its eventual fate. The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is an international world-class experiment dedicated to addressing these questions as it searches for leptonic charge-parity symmetry violation, stands ready to capture supernova neutrino bursts, and seeks to observe nucleon decay as a signature of a grand unified theory underlying the standard model. The DUNE far detector technical design report (TDR) describes the DUNE physics program and the technical designs of the single- and dual-phase DUNE liquid argon TPC far detector modules. This TDR is intended to justify the technical choices for the far detector that flow down from the high-level physics goals through requirements at all levels of the Project. Volume I contains an executive summary that introduces the DUNE science program, the far detector and the strategy for its modular designs, and the organization and management of the Project. The remainder of Volume I provides more detail on the science program that drives the choice of detector technologies and on the technologies themselves. It also introduces the designs for the DUNE near detector and the DUNE computing model, for which DUNE is planning design reports. Volume II of this TDR describes DUNE's physics program in detail. Volume III describes the technical coordination required for the far detector design, construction, installation, and integration, and its organizational structure. Volume IV describes the single-phase far detector technology. A planned Volume V will describe the dual-phase technology.},

XENONnT has already reported the world's best constraint on the flavor-independent effective neutrino magnetic moment with almost twice the exposure and improved systematics. We extend this analysis and derive constraints on all the possible electromagnetic interactions and flavor universal light gauge boson couplings and masses, which could contribute to the neutrino-electron elastic scattering process. We consider both flavor-independent and flavor-dependent interactions of the neutrino magnetic moments, millicharges, charge radii, and anapole moments for the electromagnetic interactions. The new limits on the magnetic moment, millicharge, vector, and scalar interactions are improved by about one order of magnitude. At the same time, there is relatively weaker improvement in the case of neutrino charge radii and anapole moments.},

Within the minimal Standard Model they serve as determinations of the weak mixing angle which are competitive with and complementary to those obtained near the Z-resonance. In the context of new physics beyond the Standard Model these measurements are crucial to discriminate between models and to reduce the allowed parameter space within a given model. We illustrate this for the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model with or without R-parity.},

The quantity Evise.m. = Eν − Eν' (Eν and Eν' are initial and final neutrino energies in the laboratory system) is equal, to a good approximation, to the visible energy deposited in an electromagnetic calorimeter commonly used for the identification of the elastic neutrino-electron scattering. It is shown that for Eν ⪅ 1000 GeV the radiative correction δ (Eν, y) is rather small (⪅3%) and depends weakly on y in contrast to the usually considered in terms of the variable y = E'e/Eν (E'e is the final electron laboratory energy), δ (Eν, y), which is rather large (up to 10%) and dependes violently on y. It is shown also that for sin2θw = 0.20−0.23 one-loop corrections to the cross-section ratio R = σνe/σνe are negligible as compared both with current and proposed experimental errors.},

Oscillations will be manifested as a difference in the rate and energy spectrum of νμ−CC interactions measured in the two detectors. Because most interactions observed in MINOS are inelastic, the νμ energy is reconstructed as the sum of the energy carried by the muon and that seen in the hadronic shower emanating from the struck nucleus. The latter is sensitive to uncertainties in the hadronisation process, chief among them those due to intranuclear re-scattering (i.e., final state interactions). We discuss the simulation of intranuclear re-scattering currently used by MINOS and its effect on quantities observable in the experiment.},

This differs from the standard method of maximum likelihood in that the normalisation of the probability distribution function is allowed to vary. It is thus applicable to problems in which the number of samples obtained is itself a relevant measurement. If the function is such that its size and shape can be independently varied, then the estimates given by the extended method are identical to the standard maximum likelihood estimators, though the errors require care of interpretation. If the function does not have this property, then extended maximum likelihood can give better results.},
