\def\Abstract{%
Measuring a large neutrino magnetic moment would be a clear indication of physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM), shedding light on the correct BSM theory or the potential Majorana nature of neutrinos. It would manifest in the NOvA Near Detector as an excess of neutrino-on-electron elastics scattering interactions at low electron recoil energies. Leveraging an intense and highly pure muon neutrino beam, along with the finely segmented liquid scintillator near detector specifically designed for electromagnetic shower separation, enables NOvA to achieve world-leading sensitivity in probing the effective muon neutrino magnetic moment.
%An enhanced effective muon neutrino magnetic moment would manifest in NOvA as a low electron energy excess of neutrino-on-electron elastic scattering events in its near detector. NOvA could provide a world leading limit on the effective muon neutrino magnetic moment by looking at the neutrino-on-electron elastic scattering. This thesis talks about the high level analysis methods used to distinguish the neutrino-on-electron signal and to extract the magnetic moment parameters.
Despite facing statistical limitations stemming from the low cross section of the signal process, systematic uncertainties have a significant impact on this result.
%Some of the largest systematic uncertainty in this analysis and in NOvA in general stem from the lack of understanding of the detector response to various particles. These can be reduced by carefully investigating each aspect of the NOvA analysis. We discuss the NOvA Test Beam experiment which aims to reduce one of the largest systematic uncertainty for neutrino oscillation measurements, the detector response uncertainty. Specifically, we discuss the calibration of the Test Beam detector, which is crucial for analysing the Test Beam data and applying them to the NOvA analyses.
To address these challenges, the NOvA Test Beam experiment focuses on mitigating some of the largest systematic uncertainties within NOvA by investigating particle interactions and energy deposition in a small-scale replica NOvA detector. We discuss the calibration of the NOvA Test Beam detector, which is a crucial step in analysing the Test Beam data before they can be utilised to reduce NOvA systematic uncertainties.
