%Explicitly say what I have done in a very short summary

In this thesis, I presented the search for the effective muon neutrino magnetic moment by looking for an excess of \gls{nuone} elastic scattering events above the \gls{SM} background. Using the \gls{NOvA} \gls{ND} data collected between 2014 and 2021, corresponding to an exposure of $13.8\times10^{20}$~\gls{POT}, no excess was observed. A goodness-of-fit test for the \gls{SM}-only hypothesis yielded a p-value of 0.31. I placed an upper limit on the effective muon neutrino magnetic moment at $\mu_{\nu_\mu}<19.1\times 10^{-10}\mu_B$ at $90\%$~\gls{CL}. Future iterations of this analysis will enhance \gls{NOvA}'s sensitivity through increased statistics and a reduction in systematics uncertainties, especially in neutrino beam prediction and detector modelling.

%%% Test Beam detector calibration
The \gls{NOvA} Test Beam experiment plays a crucial role in reducing detector-related uncertainties by providing a controlled environment to study known particles with well-understood energies inside a small-scale \gls{NOvA} detector. This work presented the first complete calibration of the Test Beam detector - an essential step in leveraging Test Beam data to reduce systematic uncertainties in \gls{NOvA}. While most detector cells were successfully calibrated, some remained uncalibrated due to underfilled cells or dead channels. Several improvements could further enhance calibration performance for the Test Beam detector and across \gls{NOvA}.

Key areas for improvement include refining the threshold and shielding corrections, potentially making them entirely data-driven, to improve calibration accuracy and reducing cell-by-cell variations. Additionally, enabling per-cell calibration rather than relying on run and subrun numbers would help correct issues caused by faulty \glspl{FEB}, ensuring that temporarily malfunctioning cells are properly calibrated. This requires modifying input files and calibration procedures to allow for per-cell adjustments. The Test Beam detector also provides a unique opportunity to study environmental effects and scintillator ageing, which could help explain long-term drifts observed in \gls{NOvA} detectors. Future work should explore dividing the Test Beam calibration into shorter time periods while ensuring sufficient statistics for attenuation fits. Further improvements could come from optimizing attenuation profile binning to better match actual cell dimensions, enhancing overall calibration precision.

%%% Data-based simulation
This work included the development of a dedicated data-based simulation of cosmic muons. Compared to the \gls{CRY} \gls{MC} simulation used in other detectors, this new approach improves efficiency while avoiding bias from the input data. Although originally designed for Test Beam calibration, it has broader applications, including \gls{ND} and \gls{FD}  calibration and other cosmic ray studies. One limitation is that the simulation does not accurately model the energies of through-going muons. While this does not impact its use for calibration, it may be a constraint for other applications. However, future improvements could address this by incorporating real measurements of the cosmic muon energy distribution. Additional enhancements, such as improved track reconstruction and refined event selection, could further optimize the simulation.
