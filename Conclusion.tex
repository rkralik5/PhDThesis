\chapter{Conclusion}\label{sec:Conclusion}

This analysis, based on neutrino data collected between 2014 and 2021, corresponding to an exposure of $13.8\times10^{20}$ protons-on-target, yields a result consistent with the Standard Model-only hypothesis with a p-value of 0.31. An upper limit on the effective muon neutrino magnetic moment is set at $\mu_{\nu_\mu}<19.1\times 10^{-10}\mu_B$ at $90\%$ confidence level.

We analysed the selection of \gls{nuone} events in the \gls{NOvA} \gls{ND} searching for a possible signal of the effective muon neutrino magnetic moment. We found the \gls{BF} value of $\mu_{\nu_\mu,\acrshort{BF}}=\left(1.13^{+0.50}_{-0.99}\right)\times 10^{-9}\mu_B$. We failed to reject the null hypothesis that the observed events can be described by \gls{SM} interactions only and placed an upper limit on the effective muon neutrino magnetic moment of $\mu_{\nu_\mu}<19.1\times10^{-10}\mu_B$ at $90\%$ \gls{CL}.

Should be mirroring the abstract more than the introduction. this is the first first people read (after abstract)

Explicitly say what I have done in a very short summary

The conclusion of the Test Beam calibration is in ... The Test Beam detector was successfully calibrated and is used in the analyses...

The measurement of the effective muon neutrino magnetic moment is presented here... And the final number is . The POT

Also mention further work referring to summaries and such. Just summarise everything.
