%Explicitly say what I have done in a very short summary

In this thesis, I presented the search for the effective muon neutrino magnetic moment by looking for an excess of \gls{nuone} elastic scattering events above the \gls{SM} background. Using the \gls{NOvA} \gls{ND} data collected between 2014 and 2021, corresponding to an exposure of $13.8\times10^{20}$~\gls{POT}, no excess was observed. A goodness-of-fit test for the \gls{SM}-only hypothesis yielded a p-value of 0.31. I placed an upper limit on the effective muon neutrino magnetic moment at $\mu_{\nu_\mu}<19.1\times 10^{-10}\mu_B$ at $90\%$~\gls{CL}. Future iterations of this analysis will enhance \gls{NOvA}'s sensitivity through increased statistics and a reduction in systematics uncertainties, especially in neutrino beam prediction and detector modelling.

The NOvA Test Beam experiment will be crucial in minimizing detector-related uncertainties. I described the first full calibration of the Test Beam detector, which is essential for applying the Test Beam data in reducing systematic uncertainties in \gls{NOvA}. 


%%% Data-based simulation
This work included the development of a dedicated data-based simulation of cosmic muons. Compared to the \gls{CRY} \gls{MC} simulation used in other detectors, this new approach improves efficiency while avoiding bias from the input data. Although originally designed for Test Beam calibration, it has broader applications, including \gls{ND} and \gls{FD}  calibration and other cosmic ray studies. One limitation is that the simulation does not accurately model the energies of through-going muons. While this does not impact its use for calibration, it may be a constraint for other applications. However, future improvements could address this by incorporating real measurements of the cosmic muon energy distribution. Additional enhancements, such as improved track reconstruction and refined event selection, could further optimize the simulation.
